I created an e-commerce app. I created a parent component called App.jsx with a state that held an array of all of the items with their prices and descriptions. I also created
a product list component that received the product list from the app component as a prop and mapped the list to display each product. I then created the product item component
which received the individual product data as props from the ProductList component.
I also created a css file called ProductItem.css which styled the overall page. I left the default
App.css file for styling as well.
